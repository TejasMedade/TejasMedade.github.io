Welcome to my portfolio website!

This website showcases my skills and projects that I've worked on. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to be responsive and accessible on all devices.

You can navigate through the website by using the navigation menu at the top of the page. The "About" page gives an overview of my background and experience, while the "Portfolio" page features a selection of my most recent and notable projects.

You can also find my CV and contact information on the website, if you are interested in working with me or would like to get in touch.

If you have any feedback or suggestions for how I can improve the website, please feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request on the GitHub repository.

Thank you for visiting!
